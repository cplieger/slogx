// Package capture provides a slog.Handler that records log records for
// assertion in tests, plus helpers to install it as the default logger.
//
// It is a separate package from slogx on purpose: the testing import and the
// record buffer are test-support machinery that should never reach slogx's
// production consumers. Import it only from _test.go files.
//
// Attributes and groups added through Logger.With / Logger.WithGroup are
// captured with the same nesting a real handler would emit: derived handles
// share the recorder's buffer and materialize their inherited context into
// each stored record, so Records reflects what production output would
// contain. Use Records for anything the convenience methods do not cover.
//
// Captured records are render-faithful: they hold what a stdlib TextHandler
// or JSONHandler would emit, not the verbatim call-site input. At ingestion
// the recorder applies the attribute output rules of the slog.Handler
// contract — values are resolved (slog.LogValuer), a zero Attr is dropped, a
// group with no attrs is dropped, and an empty-keyed group has its attrs
// inlined into its parent.

// nested inside groups are out of scope - walk Records() directly for those.
// Values compare by their RENDERED form (slog.Value.String()), so an
// assertion is kind-agnostic: an Int64 7 renders "7", a string "7" renders
// "7", and a test pinning a logged count does not care which the code chose.
// The empty string is a wildcard for both scoping parameters: msgSub ""
// matches every record, key "" matches every attribute.
//
// The Exact-suffixed members (AttrValueExact, AttrValuesExact) scope the
// message by equality instead of substring, the same relation CountExact has
// to Count. There msg is a whole message, so "" is NOT a wildcard: it matches
// a record whose Message is empty and nothing else. key "" stays a wildcard
// for them.
//
// Attr is the one TYPED member of the family, for the assertion the rendered
// helpers cannot make: that a value is of a particular slog.Kind. Reach for it
// when the kind is the contract and for nothing else — a test that only needs
// the text is clearer through AttrValue, and one that needs a whole record's
// shape (its level, its complete key set, several values at once) still wants a
// Records() walk.

// Attr returns the typed value of the first top-level attribute named key on
// a captured record whose Message contains msgSub, in capture order, and
// whether one was found. It is the primitive behind AttrValue, which renders
// this result.
//
// It exists for the contract a rendered comparison cannot express: that a
// value was logged as a particular KIND. slog.Time("at", t) and
// slog.String("at", t.String()) render identically, so AttrValue cannot tell
// a caller which one the code chose, and a JSON handler renders them very
// differently downstream. An assertion on Kind() pins that choice; one on the
// rendered text does not.
//
// A KindGroup value is detached from the recorder's storage before it is
// returned (its attrs are rebuilt on fresh slices, recursively), so holding
// the result across later captures is safe — the same isolation Records()
// gives. Values are already resolved at ingestion, so the result is never
// KindLogValuer. One boundary is inherited rather than closed: a KindAny
